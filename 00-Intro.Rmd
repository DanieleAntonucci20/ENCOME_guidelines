  1. The **HEADER**: Selecting the "user" icon a drop-down menu will be shown. Within the latter, the following functions can be accessed:
```{r frontend, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ENCOME frontend interface", out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Facade1.png")
```
      - **General**
      
          - *Home*: return all home page
