The renovation of existing buildings has a particularly high potential. It is therefore logical, from an economic and operational point of view, to implement appropriate energy saving measures when a building is renovated. The ENergy COnservation MEasure (ENCOME) tool developed by Eurac in different projects (MATRYCS, MODERATE, INFINITE) aims to evaluate the best trad-off between reduction of energy consumption of building and improving comfort, cost of interventions and de-risking in energy efficiency. 1.1 How it works Figure 1.1: Flow-chart of ENCOME tool The tool provides: BUILDING EMERGY SIMULATION the (sensible) energy need for heating and cooling, based on hourly or monthly calculations the internal temperature, based on hourly calculations; the sensible heating and cooling load, based on hourly calculations; trough the implementation of the ISO-52016:2017 calculation. The calculation methods can be used for residential or non-residential buildings, or a part of it, referred to as “the building” or the “assessed object”. BUILDING ENERGY OPTIMIZATION (ongoing) One of the main issue related to building energy simulation is the reduction of the gap between real data and simulated data The goal consists in the development of a calibration approach to reduce the differences between building simulation and real monitored data (performance gap) using a Particle Swarm Optimization tool and Genetic algorithm in dynamic building simulation. The tools works on some specific factor that affects the calculation of the energy consumption of the building such as the internal radiative and convective heat transfer coefficients. ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASUREs Based on the simulated and calibrated data, the tool provides the possibility to reduce the energy consumption of the building selecting different ECMs related to facade and energy systems.

"],["interface.html", "Chapter 2 Interface", " Chapter 2 Interface The interface consists mainly of 3 basic parts: The HEADER: Selecting the “user” icon a drop-down menu will be shown. Within the latter, the following functions can be accessed: Figure 2.1: ENCOME frontend interface General Home: return all home page Admin: link to the administrator page where user creation and management is possible. Only for administrator users. Components Walls: link to the database of the available opaque vertical components Roofs and Floors: link to the database of available opaque horizontal components Windows: link to the database of available transparent components Heat Loss Thermal Bridges: link to the abacus of thermal bridges Documentation Guide: link to the guidelines of the tool Logout: disconnection to the application The DRAWER: in the left drawer is it possible to visualize 4 main tool functionality: Home: Homepage of tool, where the list o buildings are visualized Building: Page with building cards, to be selected for system and building inputs Simulation: Page with building cards for simulations, calibration, and visualization of results ECM: Page of building to apply Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs).

"],["building.html", "Chapter 3 Building 3.1 Add new building 3.2 Buildings List 3.3 Audit page", " Chapter 3 Building Figure 3.1: User Buildings In the building page the user can visualize and mange all its buildings. 3.1 Add new building In order to create a new building the following information is required from the user: Building Name: name of the building Building Year: year of construction Building Typology: list of possible building typology (i.e. “school”, “residential”, “office”, etc.) Project Name: Name of the project to which the buildings belongs to. Simulation Name: the building can be simulated several times, if you want to save the different simulations you need to identify it during the creation of the building The user should place the building in the map. This step is important to connect the tool to the weather data (connection to PVGIS site https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/ ) If the building is not placed in the map an error will come up. Figure 3.2: Error if building is not placed in a map during the creation 3.2 Buildings List In a specific page it is possible to visualize the list of buildings as cards, selecting one the Audit inputs is opened. Figure 3.3: List of buildings 3.3 Audit page In the audit page the user should provide inputs related to building and systems according to the ISO 52016. Th following 9 cards should be filled: 3.3.1 General In the general page a summary of the inputs provided during the creation of the building is shown. Figure 3.4: Audit - General Page 3.3.2 Geometry the following information should be provided: - Perimeter of the building [m]: it is the length, the linear measurement around an entire building in meter. - Slab-on-ground area: area of the building in contact to the ground in m2 - Wall thickness: Average thickness of the external walls in meter - Useful building area: total area of all enclosed spaces measured to the internal face of the external walls in in m2 - Building Volume: Volume of the building in in m3 - height: external height of the building in meter Figure 3.5: Geometry Page 3.3.3 Envelope In this tab all the information related to the properties of the Envelope should be provided. Opaque Vertical Components: For each building exposure it is necessary to select all type of opaque vertical component. The component is taken from a specific database provided by the tool and can be augmented with user-defined components. Access to the database can be done directly through the button below : “DB Wall Components” or through the user drop-down menu in the user section at the top of the header: Components -&gt; Walls Figure 3.6: Opaque Vertical Components Page Transparent Vertical Components: For each building exposure it is necessary to select all type of transparent vertical component. The component is taken from a specific database provided by the tool and can be augmented with user-defined components.
